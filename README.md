Oxehealth Frontend Developer Challenge

Attached is a small nodejs expressjs server and two sketches that give an overview of a dashboard and a new rover popup.
The webserver outputs mars rover statuses, with a POST endpoint that lets you add new rovers.
Live rover statuses are output from the server using `socket.io`, new rovers can be added with `POST /add-rover/:name`

Write a web frontend which implements the sketched dashboard and pop-up. 

We would recommend spending a maximum of 4 hours on the challenge. If you have a partial solution please send that through with notes to outline your remaini
ng plan.
